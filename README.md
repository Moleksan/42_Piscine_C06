# 42_Piscine_C06  
  
This repository contains solutions for the C 06 module of the C Piscine @ 42. In this project, we focus on handling command-line arguments and manipulating strings in C. Below is a breakdown of each exercise.  
  
Exercises  
- Exercise 00: ft_print_program_name  
  
Objective: Create a program that displays its own name followed by a new line.  
  
Prototype: 

        int main(int argc, char *argv[]);  
  
Learnings: Understanding how to access program name and manage program arguments. 
  
- Exercise 01: ft_print_params  
  
Objective: Write a program that displays all the command-line arguments given to it, one per line.  

Prototype:  
  
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]);  
Learnings: Working with command-line arguments and displaying output correctly.  
  
- Exercise 02: ft_rev_params  

Objective: Create a program that displays the command-line arguments in reverse order.  
  
Prototype: 
  
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]);  
  
Learnings: Managing arrays of strings and reversing their order for output.  
  
- Exercise 03: ft_sort_params  
   
Objective: Implement a program that sorts the command-line arguments in ASCII order and displays them.  
  
Prototype:  
  
         int main(int argc, char *argv[]);  
  
Learnings: Sorting strings and understanding ASCII values for string comparison.  
  
The C Piscine C 06 project focuses on handling command-line arguments in C, enhancing our understanding of string manipulation. Through  various exercises, we learned to display the program's name, print and reverse command-line parameters, and sort them in ASCII order. This project reinforced key programming concepts, such as managing arrays of strings and understanding how to access and process user input from the command line. The skills gained in this module are crucial for developing efficient C programs that interact dynamically with users,  laying a strong foundation for future projects and programming challenges.
